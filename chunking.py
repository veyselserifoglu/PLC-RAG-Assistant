"""
DocumentPreprocessingAndChunkingModule (Combined):

Primary Responsibility: Handling all aspects of processing documents, whether for ingestion into a vector store or for direct use as LLM context.
Key Tasks:
Parsing various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.).
Extracting raw text content.
Cleaning the extracted text.
Chunking the cleaned text into appropriately sized and semantically coherent segments.
Extracting and associating relevant metadata with each chunk.
Output: A list of processed document chunks, each with its content and metadata.
Note: This module will be developed later, as the current focus is on query processing.
Handling User-Uploaded Documents (Future Decision Logic):

The system will eventually need logic to determine how an uploaded document is used:
As direct context for an LLM to answer questions about that document.
As a "query by example" to find similar documents within the existing vector store.
Or a hybrid approach.
The DocumentPreprocessingAndChunkingModule will be crucial for preparing the uploaded document in any of these scenarios.
