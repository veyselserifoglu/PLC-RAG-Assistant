We are developing a PLC RAG Assistant, a server-hosted application designed to help students and programmers with their PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) tasks.

The core of the system is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This involves:

Ingesting and processing PLC documentation (like CODESYS manuals) and PLC code.
Using embedding models to create vector representations of this data.
Storing these embeddings in a vector database.
When a user asks a question via a web-based chat interface:
The system analyzes and potentially rewrites the query.
It retrieves relevant information (chunks) from the vector database.
These chunks are then re-ranked for relevance.
The retrieved, re-ranked context is combined with the processed query and sent to a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an answer.
The system includes a loop for evaluating and refining the response before presenting it to the user.
We've discussed using tools like Dify.AI for the chat interface (acting as an MCP client) and building a custom RAG backend (acting as an MCP server) to handle the specialized PLC data processing, chunking, embedding, and retrieval logic. The system will also support user authentication and allow users to upload their own documents for session-specific context. The entire application is intended to be deployed locally on a university server using Docker containers and open-source components.

Our current focus seems to be on refining the architecture, experimenting with different components (like chunking strategies, embedding models, LLMs via notebooks), and planning the development and testing phases.


project missing components: 

To ensure we can achieve all the goals outlined in your SYSTEM_DEFINITION.md, particularly around personalized assistance, PLC-specific processing, and the Dify.AI (MCP Client) + Custom RAG (MCP Server) model, here are a few areas in the architecture that could benefit from more explicit definition or refinement:

MCP Interface & Interaction Flow:

Current: The diagrams show a "Backend Application" or "RAG Core Service." The "Deployment Diagram" mentions "OpenWebUI" (which we've discussed could be Dify.AI).
Refinement Needed: If Dify.AI acts as the MCP client, we should explicitly show this in the deployment and high-level diagrams. More importantly, the interaction flow between Dify.AI (client) and your custom RAG backend (MCP server) needs to be clear. This includes how Dify.AI passes queries and potentially user/session context to your MCP server, and how your server responds according to the MCP protocol.
Why: This is crucial for the "Dify.AI as UI, custom backend for RAG" strategy to work seamlessly.
User-Specific Document Ingestion & Retrieval Workflow:

Current: "Personalized Assistance" is a key objective. The high-level diagram shows "Temp User Docs" conceptually feeding the Vector DB. The "Advanced RAG Retrieval Strategy" is general.
Refinement Needed: We need a clearer depiction (perhaps a dedicated data flow diagram or an enhanced component interaction view) for:
How a user uploads a document via Dify.AI.
How this document is routed to your MCP server for session-specific processing (chunking, embedding).
Where these temporary, session-specific embeddings are stored (e.g., tagged in the main Vector DB, or a separate temporary store linked to the session).
How the retrieval process (in your MCP server) queries both the global knowledge base and the current user's session-specific data, ensuring isolation.
The lifecycle of this temporary data (e.g., deletion on session end).
Why: This is fundamental to achieving the "Personalized Assistance" goal securely and effectively.
Global Knowledge Base Ingestion Pipeline:

Current: The "High-Level Diagram" shows "Global KB" (CODESYS Docs, Code) feeding the "Vector DB."
Refinement Needed: While not part of the real-time query flow, the offline/batch process for ingesting and updating the global knowledge base is a significant architectural component. A simple diagram or description outlining how PLC documentation and code from GitHub are parsed, chunked (with PLC-specific logic), embedded, and loaded into the main Vector DB would be beneficial.
Why: This clarifies how the core knowledge of the system is built and maintained.
Authentication & Session Context Propagation to MCP Server:

Current: User authentication is implied for personalized features. Dify.AI would handle user login.
Refinement Needed: How does the user's identity or session context, established by Dify.AI, get securely passed to your custom RAG MCP server? Your MCP server needs this information to:
Access the correct user-specific temporary documents.
Potentially log actions per user.
Why: Essential for secure personalized assistance and data isolation between users.
Explicit PLC-Specific Processing Modules within RAG Core:

Current: "App Logic" or "RAG Core Service" is a general block.
Refinement Needed: While it might be too granular for the highest-level diagram, it's worth noting (perhaps in the description of the RAG Core Service component) that it will contain specialized modules for:
PLC Code Parsers (Structured Text, Instruction List, and future graphical languages).
PLC-Optimized Chunking Strategies.
Why: Highlights the core value proposition of the assistant being tailored for PLC programming.
